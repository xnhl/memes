On September 14 2025 I made my meme repositories private and copied them to a new account (https://github.com/wokememes), but woke cultists/crybullies at GitHub censored/removed it after just two days. I can't help but laugh at how predictable and futile their actions are, and that they imagine they have <i>any</i> chance at stopping people like me or the destruction of their deranged cult.

They are desperately clinging to their lies and delusions, and they can't tolerate anyone seeing the truth about them that people like myself have been exposing. Many of them already know, in some small corner of what's left of their barely functioning minds, that it's over and they've already lost (hence the increasing desperation and many on their side abandoning ship, especially after the madness of recent events).

The smarter choice would have been to allow me to stay in the open so that they can at least continue to observe and attempt to counter. Now that I've gone underground they will have no idea what I'm up to, and it's only going to get better/worse. I thank them for helping to inspire me to go even harder.

As promised, I've uploaded all content to some new accounts with randomized names so the cult will never be able to find and censor them. I will also continue sharing everything on other platforms which <i>truly</i> support free expression and are capable of tolerating dissent.
